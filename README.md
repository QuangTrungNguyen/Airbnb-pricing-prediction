This project trains several machine learning models in Python to predict nightly price of Airbnb listings in the Northern Beaches council area of Sydney based on features of listings
•	Performed exploratory data analysis: statistical imputation for missing values, distribution analysis of continuous features, correlation analysis of features and rental price
•	Mapped GPS coordinates into postcodes using geo-location API to generate new features representing district area and distance from each listing to two popular tourist attractions
•	Performed feature selection and trained gradient boosting trees, Lasso, Ridge with additive boosting; combined models using stacking to improve their predictive accuracy
